Rules: Use the arrow keys (right, left, up, down) to move the tiles around and merge them together. You can only merge the tiles if they’re the same number and next to each other, or if there’s a space between the 2 tiles with no tile in between. For example, if you have a 2 and a 2 next to each other with no tiles in between, you can merge them to get a 4. You can also merge multiple same tiles together, for example, if you have 4 “2” tiles, you can merge them all together to get 8. Keep doing this until you get to 2048 to win the game. However, with each merge, new “2” tiles will pop up in random empty spaces, so the objective of this game is to get to 2048 without filling up the board with no more merging opportunities (if the board is completely filled with all different tiles next to each other, you are unable to merge, therefore you would lose the game). Once you get to 2048, you will have the option to either keep playing as long as you want to get even higher numbers, or you can restart the game.
Score calculation: The score is calculated based on the number you merge. For example, merging a 2 and a 2 together will get you a 4 tile, so your score would plus 4. If you merge a 4 and a 4 to get 8, then your score will increase by 8, and so on.
